Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).



You should print one name per line, in alpha order

You should print only names that do not start with __

Your code should not be executed when imported

Make sure you are running your code in Python3.8.x (hidden_4.pyc has been compiled with this version)
